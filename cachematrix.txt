Matrix pseudo object that is able to cache the inverse of a matrix

Description:

     Matrix pseudo object that is able to cache the inverse of a matrix

Usage:

     makeCacheMatrix(x = matrix())
     
Arguments:

       x: A matrix that will be used as source data

Value:

     List of methods to call [get, set, getInverse, setInverse]


Validates that matrix object that it is non-null, numeric and
invertible

Description:

     Validates that matrix object that it is non-null, numeric and
     invertible

Usage:

     validate(data)
     
Arguments:

    data: A matrix that is invertible

Value:

     logical TRUE (validated) or FALSE (non-valid)


Gets the inverse of a makeCacheMatrix, using cache if possible

Description:

     Gets the inverse of a makeCacheMatrix, using cache if possible

Usage:

     cacheSolve(x, ...)
     
Arguments:

       x: makeCacheMatrix closure with an invertible matrix in it

     ...: aditional parameters passed to solve
